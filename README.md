## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (v18 or higher recommended) and npm (or Yarn) installed.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd saraswathi-temple-app # Or whatever your project folder name is
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

    npm install
    # Or if you use Yarn:
    # yarn install

    *If you encountered specific issues during development and added many modules, you might have run a longer install command previously. `npm install` (without arguments) is sufficient after cloning.*

3.  **Set up Firebase (if applicable):**
    If your project uses Firebase, you'll need to set up your Firebase configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase credentials:

    # Example .env file content (replace with your actual Firebase config)
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
    
    *Make sure these match what's expected in your Firebase initialization code.*

## üèÉ Running the Project

To start the development server:

npm start
# Or if you use Yarn:
# yarn start
Okay, you got it! You're looking for the Markdown "code" that makes up a README.md file, including sections for actual code snippets like installation commands.

Here's a template for your temple website's README.md file. You can copy this content directly into a file named README.md in the root of your project.

    *Make sure these match what's expected in your Firebase initialization code.*

## üèÉ Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# Or if you use Yarn:
# yarn start
This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is in use). The page will reload if you make edits.

üì¶ Building for Production
To create a production-ready build of the application:

Bash

npm run build
# Or if you use Yarn:
# yarn build
This command builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
